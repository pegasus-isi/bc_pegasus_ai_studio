# Studio's own home directory for an Open OnDemand session (issue #1,
# pegasus-isi/studio-webapp#482).
#
# Sourced by script.sh, which OOD stages beside this file. It is plain shell
# rather than ERB so tests/test-studio-home.sh can run the real thing.
#
# Why Studio gets its own home: everything it writes is $HOME-relative (its
# database, the marketplace checkout, ~/.pegasusrc, the generated CLAUDE.md and
# AGENTS.md, and the configs its tool adapters write for codex, opencode and
# claude). Under KubeSpawner the home is a volume that exists only for Studio.
# On a cluster it is the user's real home, and a first launch would overwrite
# their own setup of those very tools. The container is therefore started with
# `apptainer --home "$STUDIO_HOME"`, and this file decides, checks and
# prepares that directory.

# studio_home_resolve REQUESTED DEFAULT REAL_HOME
#
# Prints the absolute Studio home: REQUESTED if given, else DEFAULT. A leading
# `~` is expanded against REAL_HOME, since that is how people type paths into a
# form. Fails, with the reason on stderr, for anything that would put Studio's
# files back among the user's own:
#   - a relative path (it would resolve against the job's output directory);
#   - the real home itself, which is exactly what this exists to avoid;
#   - an ancestor of the real home (/home, /): Studio would scan and write
#     across other users' directories, and treat the real home as a subfolder.

# Studio database and the OpenCode password) and links in the entries of the
# whitespace-separated INHERIT list, relative to both homes. A link is made
# only when the entry exists in the real home and nothing at all (not even a
# dangling link) is at the target: a user who replaced one with their own copy
# keeps it, and a second session never rewrites anything.
#
# This is what keeps a cluster account's own credentials working inside the
# isolated home: an HTCondor IDTOKEN in ~/.condor/tokens.d, git's identity in
# ~/.gitconfig. They are links rather than copies so a refreshed token is
# picked up without relaunching.
